# Psychometric properties of GRIT-O scale

The current project assess the psychometric properties of a widely used 
measure in psychology, GRIT-O (Duckworkth & Quinn, 2009). This measure have been widely used in school settings in order to model the achievement motivation and drive of students. 
This project assess how well the theorized factor structure of GRIT-O scale fits the data retrived from Openpsychometrics. 
To get accurate description of scale outliers in reponse time have been removed. The model shows 
poor to moderate fit, and Scalar invariance failed to hold between genders (Meredith, 1993). The results suggests that GRIT-O scale isn't comparable between groups and 
there is significant bias in the scores for groups.
